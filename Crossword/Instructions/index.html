            The clues are numbered from 1 across and 1 down, to signify which direction the word goes. When completing a crossword puzzle, the goal is to solve every clue and enter every letter and word on the grid.
<br><br>
You can solve the clues in any order. Some clues may be for longer words, abbreviations, acronyms, etc. Crossword puzzles push you to think about the clues differently, and the puzzles have a specific way of telling you what kind of answer they are looking for.

Once you have solved all the clues, you have finished the crossword puzzle
